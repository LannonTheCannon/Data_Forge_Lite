# 🚀 Data-Forge-Lite

> **Forge smarter insights from your data — no coding required.**  

**Data-Forge-Lite** is a lightweight, AI-powered Streamlit app designed to help you clean, engineer, and explore your datasets with **interactive mind maps** and **visual storytelling** — all without needing to touch a single line of code.

Built for data analysts, students, educators, and data explorers who want to *wrangle their data like pros* — and *have fun doing it.*

## 🌟 What You Can Do

- **🧹 Upload and Auto-Clean Your Data**  
  Upload your CSV files and watch DataForge-Explorer clean and engineer your features with intelligent defaults.

- **🧠 Explore with Interactive Mind Maps**  
  Navigate your data relationships visually with AI-generated questions and structured exploration paths.

- **📊 Create Visuals with Natural Language**  
  Ask questions like *"Create a bar chart of sales by region"* — and generate editable code and plots instantly.

- **💬 Co-Create with AI**  
  Every question you ask generates code, charts, and data wrangling snippets you can tweak and evolve right in the app.
